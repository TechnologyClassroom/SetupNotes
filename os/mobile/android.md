# Android

[Android](https://www.android.com/) is the
[#1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Mobile_devices)
mobile phone operating system and uses the
[Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/).

The majority of Android is free and open source through the
[Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/), but the phone
manufacturers (including Google) frequently add proprietary apps and drivers that cannot be audited
or removed.

## Recommended phones and tablets

Most phones that can be purchased at mobile phone stores are not very good.
They usually are locked down to a specific carrier with unwanted programs
pre-installed including spyware and have a locked bootloader. None of which is
good.

The Google line of phones all come with
[stock Android](https://developers.google.com/android/images) and can be
purchased with an unlocked bootloader through their website. Older unlocked
Google phones can be found cheaper on ebay.

When buying a new phone, consult whether the phone is supported by alternative
operating systems. Check the [GrapheneOS installer](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) and the 
[LineageOS Download page](https://download.lineageos.org/) first
to see what your options are. It is much easier to buy a phone that will do
what you want rather than making an unsupported phone do what.

If you already have a phone that I would not recommend, remember this for the
next time that you are shopping for a phone.

## Alternative versions of Android

I would suggest using [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/). GrapheneOS is a security hardened version of Android.

Anoterh options that I would recommend and have personally used is [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/). I would also consider trying [DivestOS](https://divestos.org/).

Before changing the OS, make a backup of your files and OS.

Beware of unofficial releases of operating systems. The operating system must
be trusted more than any of the rest of the software on your phone. If the
author is a random person on a forum that does not use their real name, would
you trust giving that person access to your location, communication and browsing history, and passwords? You should
not trust an individual on the Internet that is anonymous.

Read and follow the documentation for installing new operating systems on your
phone.

If checksums are available, make sure that your download is correct.

If signing keys are available, make sure the download came from the developer.

## App Stores

Unlike Apple iOS, there are many different app stores available for Android, but
only one of them is good.

### F-Droid

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) is a free and open source app repository for
Android based phones. Applications that may not have your best interests will
list their antifeatures. Most applications found in F-Droid contain Richard
Stallman's Four Freedoms.

Most phones will come with Google Play Store preinstalled. I do not trust
Google and I only use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) for daily usage.

F-Droid can be installed on any Android based phone and do not require on of
the recommended alternatives.

If an app has features that you may not like, they are clearly marked as
anti-features.

#### F-Droid Apps

There are many apps on F-Droid. Searching for useful apps is kind of difficult
if you are new to F-Droid. These are my favorite apps separated by category

## adb

`adb` is a command line program to interact with Android based mobile phones.

### Enabling developer mode

I cannot remember if this is a prerequisite for this process as I always do it first thing to a new phone install.

* Open the `Settings` app.
* Select the `About Phone` option.
* Find the `Build number`. Tap on that several times until it says that you enabled developer mode.
* Go back a page and select the `System` option.
* Select the `Developer options` option.
* Enable the `USB debugging` option.
* Exit the settings app.

### Install

Install adb on a Debian based GNU/Linux distribution.  `adb` works for other
operating systems, but I am only documenting GNU/Linux.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y adb
```

### Backup

Connect the phone to the computer.

Start the adb server and list phones.

```
sudo adb devices
```

At this point, the phone asks you for permssion.

Enter the shell on the phone.

```
adb shell
```

List the files on the phone.

```
ls sdcard
```

Exit the adb shell.

```
exit
```

Make a directory to dump the files in.

```
mkdir ebooks
```

Change into that directory.

```
cd ebooks
```

Pull a folder.

```
adb pull /sdcard/ebooks/
```

Make another folder and backup another folder.

```
mkdir ../camera
cd ../camera
adb pull /sdcard/DCIM/OpenCamera/
```

Once you know all of the folders you want to backup, you can build a script to
run through the process.
