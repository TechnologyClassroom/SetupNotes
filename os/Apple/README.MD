# Apple notes

Do not buy Apple products.  If you (or someone else) already fell for their
marketing scheme, here are some guides to make the best of the situation.

- [MacOSX.md](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SetupNotes/blob/master/os/Apple/MacOSX.md)
  shows how to configure or upgrade the Mac OS X operating system.
- [MacOSXTerminal.md](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SetupNotes/blob/master/os/Apple/MacOSXTerminal.md)
  has many of my favorite commands for the Mac Terminal.  With Terminal, you can
  use the Unix system that runs the system.  The drawback is an extremely lower
  number of available applications than FreeBSD or GNU/Linux and the software is
  out of date with GPL2 only applications.
- [iPadiPod.md](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SetupNotes/blob/master/os/Apple/iPadiPod.md)
  shows how to configure iPads & iPods only the apps you want for your program
  area and prevent children from browsing inappropriate materials and adding
  their own apps.
- [Teleprompter.md](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SetupNotes/blob/master/os/Apple/Teleprompter.md)
  shows one way to configure a teleprompter setup using a Mac, two ipods, and a
  router.  There are cheaper ways to do this, but I was given all of those
  materials and asked to come up with a solution.  The process uses VNC to share
  the screen between the devices.
