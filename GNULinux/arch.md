# Arch Linux

Arch has a steep learning curve for users that are new to GNU/Linux.  I would only suggest using Arch if you have used GNU/Linux as your primary operating system for at least 6 months.  After the arduous installation is complete, the system is very nice to use.

[Arch webpage](https://www.archlinux.org/)

[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) - an extensive resource for Arch and other GNU/Linux operating systems

[The Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way_(%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8)) - the philosophy behind Arch

[Arch Packages](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/) - compiled software available for the system

[Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) - a set of build scripts for more software

# Downloading Arch

# Installing Arch

As a right of passage, you should install Arch using only the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).  Take notes as you go.  You will learn more about the system if you avoid blog posts and youtube videos the first time.

If you give a full attempt and fail, try (Antegros](https://antergos.com/try-it/) or [ArchBang](http://bbs.archbang.org/) which are Arch based distributions that still use the default Arch repositories.

On your second install, the installation can be automated with [ArchFi](https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi).

# AUR and pacaur

As a right of passage, you should install your first packages yourself using the Arch wiki.  Package managers exist for the AUR.  Install cower and pacaur first.  Once you have pacaur, more software can be easily installed from the AUR.

On your second install, the installation for pacaur can be automated with this bash script: https://gist.github.com/Tadly/0e65d30f279a34c33e9b
