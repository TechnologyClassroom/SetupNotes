# Google Chrome / Chromium

Michael McMahon

Google Chrome and Chromium are popular Internet browsers.

Do not place trust in Google Chrome.

After installing, click on the sandwich menu in the top right corner of the
screen and choose Settings.

If children have installed extensions, disable them.  If the add-on creates
extra pop up windows or intrusive ads added to other websites, report them as
you remove them.

## Settings

- Choose "Open a specific page or a set of pages. Set pages" and click on set
  pages.  Choose your organizations page or your favorite educational website.
- Click Reset to default theme.
- If you need to pull up the same page many times a day, check Show Home button.
- Uncheck Let anyone add a user to Chrome.
- Uncheck Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google.
- Check Send a "Do No Track" request along with your browsing traffic.
- Uncheck Enable Autofill to fill out web forms in a single click.
- Uncheck Offer to save your web passwords.  Everyone should be remembering
  their password.
- Check Ask where to save each file before downloading.
- Uncheck Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed.
- Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available.

## Extensions

### Style

* [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
  can customize CSS on individual pages or domains.
- [GC DeepDark Theme](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gc-deep-dark/gbkflacjgfkmilflednkmcogolnikmki)

### Utility
* [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
  sets the page that opens when you open a new tab.  Great to enable before
  giving a presentation.  Set the new page to be `about:blank` for example.
- [History 2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-2/cahejgbbfgmlmjgdjlibphdjeldhagkp?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)
  helps reviewing browsing history on a per machine basis.
- [Link Grabber](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-grabber/caodelkhipncidmoebgbbeemedohcdma)
  is useful for copying all links from a page.

### Security
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)
  removes ads from most webpages.  This is reported to decrease your network
  traffic by about 17% which increases the speed of your entire network.
- [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US)
  blocks tracking between websites.  It automatically builds your blocklist as
  you browse passively.
- [KeePassXC-Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk)
  communicates between KeePassXC to store passwords outside the browser.  I
  would suggest not saving your passwords in your browser or using this
  extension.  Instead copy and paste passwords from KeePassXC.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) defaults to using
  the https version of a website
