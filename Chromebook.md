# Chromebooks

Chromebooks are lightweight and cheap laptop replacements that are very popular
purchases for school districts.

Chromebooks typically come with ChromeOS, an operating system that is basically
just a browser :(

Once a school is taken over by Chromebooks and ChromeOS, teachers and students
use lesson plans catered to the Google infrastructure, websites, and cloud based
services and do not use offline programs.

## GalliumOS

GalliumOS is an alternative to ChromeOS that can be installed on most
Chromebooks that allows for offline program usage, programming, and more
advanced options that are not limited to a web browser.
