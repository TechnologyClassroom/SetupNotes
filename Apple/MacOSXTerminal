# Terminal Commands for Mac OS X

# Michael McMahon

# Here are examples of programs I use on the Mac to help create a creative and safe environment for the kids.

# I use the Terminal often on Mac as it is a UNIX system.  Mac uses outdated terminal commands before GPL v3 I think.  Many of the common gnu tools are there.  Homebrew (a port system) automates the download and build process of common open source software.  The software available to homebrew is limited, but includes some favorites such as minetest and wget.

# Here is a command to copy the contents of a file with admin rights as a limited user.

su adminnamehere -c sudo\ cp\ /Users/adminnamehere/HOSTSFmac.txt\ /etc/hosts
 
su adminnamehere -c sudo\ cp\ /Users/adminnamehere/HOSTSMTWRmac.txt\ /etc/hosts

# Another su example using ls to explore system directories that require root

su adminnamehere -c ls\ /Users/adminnamehere

# Notice that the escape \ character is required before spaces.  Also, note that the admin password is required twice (once for su and once for sudo).

defaults write com.apple.dock contents-immutable -bool true && killall Dock

# This command unlocks the dock

defaults write com.apple.dock contents-immutable -bool false && killall Dock
