Teleprompter Setup through VNC using a Mac and two ipods

Note: This can be done without Apple hardware.  I used Apple hardware because it was given to our organization.

	1.	Plug in router with power and ethernet.
	2.	Connect iPods & Mac to the same Network.  The password should only by shared with and used by staff.  I repeat, this network cannot be shared with members and the page with written passwords should not remain out on a desk in view of members.
	3.	On Mac, click on the apple in the top-left > System Preferences > Sharing.  Click on the Lock icon, enter admin credentials.  Check Remote Management.  Click on Computer Settings button.  Check “Show Remote…” box , check “Anyone may request...” box, check “VNC viewers may control...” box and enter a password into the password box.  Write the password down.  Click on the OK button.  Click on the circle next to the “Only these users:” option.  Click on the + box.  Click on a limited account.  Click on the Select button.  A new window will appear.  Check these boxes: Observe, Control, Show when being ovserved, Open & Quit Applications, Copy Items.  Click the OK button.  Click the open lock icon.
	4.	Notice under “Remote Management: On” that it says “Other users can manage your computer using the address XX.XX.XX.XX.”  The numbers at the end will need to be put into the next step.
	5.	On iPod: Download “VNC Viewer” from the App Store.  Open VNC Viewer.  Click the + box. Enter XX.XX.XX.XX into the address and give it a descriptive name.  Connect.  There may be a warning about unencrypted connection.  Enter the password.  Scroll over the account.  Pull up the on-screen keyboard.  Enter the password.  Now, you can see the screen.
	6.	On the Mac, open a web browser to www.cueprompter.com.  Copy the script into the text box. Choose settings that you want.

If either device becomes unresponsive, logout of the mac and log back in with the problem device.  All devices will follow along.
