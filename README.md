The one thing that has advanced my career with technology the most is taking
notes.

When I am about to do something new, I first write out what I am trying to do,
the problem that I am trying to solve, or the original error message.  I then
research the topic.  I take notes on the research and add the relevant links.
Before I follow a workflow from the Internet, I try to understand the workflow
as thoroughly as possible.  I document the process I use and add any notes about
what each step does.

If I messed up something, I should be able to refer to my notes and undo any
changes.  I then document that process.

Months later when I have forgotten the process, I can can look at my notes
instead of restarting over again at the research phase.

These are my notes.
