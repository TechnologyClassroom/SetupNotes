# Problem: Ubuntu defaults to dash instead of bash.  Bash scripts sometimes do not work.
# Solution: Remove links to dash and repace link to bash.
sudo rm /bin/sh # Remove symlink to dash
sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh # Symlink bash to sh
exec bash # Restart shell

# Links for directories work the same way.

public = yes
force user = noob # Replace noob with the username of the owner of the folder.
guest ok = yes

# Add drive to fstab manually

I often find myself trying to set a drive to automatically boot on a system.

# List the drives by uuid:
ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/

# Find the one you want and complete the ls entry using tab completion

ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f

# As root, remove the first part and replace it with echo and append it to the /etc/fstab file.

echo 926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f >> /etc/fstab

# Edit /etc/fstab:

nano /etc/fstab

# Modify the line to look like this:
UUID=926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f /mnt/desiredtmountpoint      ext4    defaults        0       2

# Change desired mountpoint to that of your chosing.

# Problem: fat32 and fat16 formatted flash drive gives errors and has trouble booting.
# Solution: Use GNU/Linux command line tools to inspect and repair problems.
# This command checked the fat32 partition for errors.  If errors are found, fix them automatically.  /dev/sdc is my flash drive in this example.
sudo dosfsck -w -r -l -a -v -t /dev/sdc1
# dosfsck complained about a dirty bit and could not automatically repair.  This command can fix a dirty bit:
sudo fsck.vfat /dev/sdc1
# My response was 2 to restore backup.
# My response was 1 and y to remove dirty bit.

Problem: Installing vim, changes vi.
Solution: Change vim to vim.tiny
$ sudo update-alternatives --config vi
There are 2 choices for the alternative vi (providing /usr/bin/vi).

  Selection    Path                Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/vim.tiny    10        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 2
update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/vim.tiny to provide /usr/bin/vi (vi) in manual mode
