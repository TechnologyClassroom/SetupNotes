When you want to install an app, do "Settings > General > Restrictions > Installing Apps" to enable and disable the App store.  Only add apps that are educational or puzzle related.  Mobile games are addictive and will get played more than anything else making it an expensive waste of money.

Make an Apple account without a credit card to use with the store.  Gift apps to the account.
