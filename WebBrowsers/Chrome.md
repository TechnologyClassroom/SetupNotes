Do not place trust in Google Chrome.

After installing, click on the sandwich menu in the top right corner of the
screen and choose Settings.

If children have installed extensions, disable them.  If the add-on creates
extra pop up windows or intrusive ads added to other websites, report them as
you remove them.
