Mozilla Thunderbird is a great free and open source email program.

# Add-ons:

-QuickText - Allows you to retrieve your commonly used text blocks.  I often copy and paste blocks of text for my work so this is very useful to me.

-TT DeepDark - Elegant dark theme for Thunderbird based on FF DeepDark.  In my opinion this is easier on the eyes.
