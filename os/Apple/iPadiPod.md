Note: Do not buy iPads or iPods for use in educational environments.  The
educational benefits of using iPads in the classroom was fabricated by Apple
public relations.  If you were given donations of these products and are
expected to implement them in some way, use this guide to control their usage.

When you want to install an app, do "Settings > General > Restrictions >
Installing Apps" to enable and disable the App store.  Only add apps that are
educational or puzzle related.  Mobile games are addictive and will get played
more than anything else making it an expensive waste of money.

Make an Apple account without a credit card to use with the store.  Gift apps to
the account.
